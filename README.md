# xilinx_pcie_ref_design

reference design for getting Xilinx XDMA IP for PCIe linking working with xilinx driver.

design uses a kintex7 device with x4 Gen2 link. I have removed the pinmap, so please add your own to get it working properly. I just left the clock pins in for reference.

checkout the pcie_driver-st_fix for getting streaming working properly.
